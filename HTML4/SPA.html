		<p>Republican Donald Trump has refused to commit to accepting the election result if he loses, in the final TV debate against Hillary Clinton.
"I will tell you at the time," he told moderator Chris Wallace. For days he has claimed the election is "rigged".
The Las Vegas debate continued the campaign's bitter tone, with Mr Trump calling Mrs Clinton a "nasty woman".
Polls show Mr Trump is losing in key battleground states after facing a slew of sexual assault allegations.
The final battle of wits came less than three weeks before election day on 8 November.</p>

		<p>Europe's Schiaparelli lander did not behave as expected as it headed down to the surface of Mars on Wednesday.
Telemetry data recovered from the probe during its descent indicates that its parachute was jettisoned too early.
The rockets it was supposed to use to bring itself to a standstill just above the ground also appeared to fire for too short a time.
The European Space Agency (Esa) has not yet conceded that the lander crashed but the mood is not positive.
Experts will continue to analyse the data and they may also try to call out to Schiaparelli in the blind hope that it is actually sitting on the Red Planet intact.
In addition, the Americans will use one of their satellites at Mars to attempt to image the targeted landing zone to see if they can detect any hardware. Although, this is a slim hope because the probe is quite small.
For the moment, all Esa has to work with in understanding what happened on Wednesday is the relatively large volume of engineering data Schiaparelli managed to transmit back to the "mothership" that dropped it off at Mars - the Trace Gas Orbiter.
This shows that everything was fine as the probe entered the atmosphere. Its heatshield appeared to do the job of slowing the craft, and the parachute opened as expected to further decelerate the robot.
But it is at the end of this parachute phase that the data indicates unusual behaviour. Not only is the chute jettisoned earlier than called for in the predicted timeline, but the retrorockets that were due to switch on immediately afterwards, fire for just three or four seconds. They were expected to fire for a good 30 seconds.
In the downlinked telemetry, Schiaparelli is seen to continue transmitting a radio signal for 19 seconds after the apparent thruster shutoff.
Esa experts say it is impossible at this stage to fully interpret what happened until they can reconstruct the velocity profile of the probe.
Once they have done that, they can match it against known events and predict the altitudes at which those events occurred.
It should then be possible to gauge with some confidence whether Schiaparelli really did crash.</p>

			North Korea has conducted an unsuccessful launch of an intermediate-range missile, according to the South Korean military.
This is the second failed test in less than a week after the North's recent launch of a Musudan missile, which has an estimated range of 4,000km (2,500 miles).
It is said to be capable of hitting US bases as far away as Guam.
The missile has been tested eight times this year, with only one success.
However, experts fear it could become operational as early as next year.
The US condemned the launch, calling it a "further provocation".
Pyongyang's last test was denounced by the UN, which has banned it from any use of ballistic or nuclear technology.
